The code in drgtk_forwardable.rb code is modified from https://github.com/takahashim/mruby-forwardable
The stated license at https://github.com/takahashim/mruby-forwardable at the time of download (10:44pm Eastern March 26 2023) was "BSDL from CRuby's"

Since drgtk_forwardable.rb serves a very similar purpose (porting CRuby's
`Forwardable` module to a different Ruby implementation, [in the case of `mruby-forwardable`, that would be mruby,
and in the present case, dragonruby-gtk]), I'm claiming the same license, the BSD License from CRuby,
to comply with the constraints of the existing license while being as permissive with this code as is allowed by the
licenses on `forwardable` in mruby & cruby.
